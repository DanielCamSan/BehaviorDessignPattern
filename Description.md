**Problem:**
The main problem in the assignment of type of transport is that you the main class have to select and create all the atributes of the
specific type of transport and doing that task maybe we overload the main class, and we dont want to do that, also when we want to change
the type of transport we have to create again the classes and set again the variable

**Solution**
To solve the main problem, i use the Behavior dessign pattern Strategy, where i can choose the way or the type of transport that i want
just changing one atribute and it will accomodate the other variables and it wont affect to the performance and it will give more quality
